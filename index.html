	<h4>Brief notes on the Projects</h4>
	<p>These were built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL. The work was organized by the MVC design pattern and object-oriented programming. Please see descriptions below as well as the source code at <a href="https://github.com/sglennie">GitHub</a>.</p>

	<h4>Project descriptions</h4>
	<h5>Login</h5>
	<p>Functions: login, change password, reset password, register member, set permissions. Built on MVC design pattern. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>CRUD</h5>
	<p>This is a table of records where you can add, edit, or delete a record. Page selector included to organize longer lists.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Form validator</h5>
	<p>Client-side validation with JavaScript and jQuery. Server-side validation with PHP.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Tag cloud</h5>
	<p>This was coded in PHP. The size of the tag in the cloud is based on the count of that tag in a page.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Login 2</h5>
	<p>UI same as Login 1. Organized by object-oriented programming and structured on MVC design pattern. </p>

	<h5>Bio</h5>
	<p>I used to build apps with MS Access which is a relational database with front-end. Tables, queries, relations, and forms influenced my approach to business requirements. I worked in cable-telecom in a variety of roles from software trainer, app support, and QA tester. In time, I gathered enough experience and domain knowledge to be the Business Analyst. That meant translating business requirements to software development teams and demonstrating the result to clients. In scrum, it was Product Owner. I've practiced UML, scrum, Kan-ban, and like many, have endured CMMI. Throughout, one thing I did was use Access to create an app to relate separate lists of data for many things. It was a tool to get my work done faster and I was often asked to upload to sharepoint so others could use it. Each tool I built fit a specific purpose and resided on various company sharepoints. I learned web development to go beyond that.</p>
