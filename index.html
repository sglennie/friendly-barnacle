	<h4>Brief note on the Projects</h4>
	<p>These apps were built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
	<p>The MVC design pattern was applied in organizing the work. OOP was also used to build Login 2.</p>  
	<br>
	<h4>Project descriptions</h4>
	<h5>Login</h5>
	<p>Built on MVC design pattern. Functions: login, change password, reset password, register member, set permissions. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>CRUD</h5>
	<p>This is a table of records. One can add, edit, or delete a record. Also included a page selector to organize longer lists.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Form validator</h5>
	<p>Client-side validation with JavaScript and jQuery. Server-side validation with PHP.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Tag cloud</h5>
	<p>This was coded in PHP. The size of the tag in the cloud is based on the count of that tag in a page.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Login 2</h5>
	<p>Object-oriented programming applied to organization of files and code. Also, structured on MVC design pattern. End-user interface is the same as Login 1.</p>

	<h5>Bio</h5>
	<p>I used to build apps with MS Access which is a relational database with front-end. Tables, queries, relations, and forms influenced my approach to business requirements. I worked in cable-telecom in a variety of roles from software trainer, app support, and QA tester. In time, I gathered enough experience and domain knowledge to be the Business Analyst. That meant translating business requirements to software development teams and demonstrating the result to clients. In scrum, it was Product Owner. I've practiced UML, scrum, Kan-ban, and like many, have endured CMMI. Throughout, one thing I did was use Access to create an app to relate separate lists of data for many things. It was a tool to get my work done faster and I was often asked to upload to sharepoint so others could use it. Each tool I built fit a specific purpose and resided on various company sharepoints. I learned web development to go beyond that.</p>
