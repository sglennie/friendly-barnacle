	Welcome to my site. I'm Steve Glennie and I built this site to show my work in web development. The apps are linked below and source code is available for each app. I'm happy to share what I've learned. Send me a note and I will reply. <a href="mailto:Steve@Glendev.com">Steve@Glendev.com</a>. In the meantime, my work continues with more apps to come. Cheers!

	<h4>Descriptions</h4>
	<p>These apps were built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Login</h5>
	<p>Functions: login, change password, lost password reset. Admin functions: register a member, edit member permissions.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Database interface</h5>
	<p>This is a user interface to a database. The app presents a table view of records with viewing options. Also, user may add or edit a record. Delete record function removed.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Form validator</h5>
	<p>This app validates user inputs on a form. It validates client-side inputs through JavaScript and also validates on server by PHP. The submit button has been programmed with php mail function to send completed forms to an email address for collection. </p>
	<br>
	<h5>Tag cloud</h5>
	<p>This app arranges and displays words from a selected source increasing word size based on frequency of that word.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Login 2</h5>
	<p>The code for this login app was strictly organized by MVP and uses OOP principles which are evident in the source code shown on GitHub. Please see "Source code".</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Source Code</h5>
	<p>This is a link to GitHub where you can view the source code for all of the apps. MVC design pattern is applied throughout. </p>

	<h5>About me</h5>
	<p>I've worked at each stage of the software development life cycle from planning, development, testing, product delivery, and support. My industry background is in Cable, Telecom, and Satellite service providers. I worked within B/OSS (business and operational support systems) as well as integration with external vendor applications. As a web developer, I build full stack applications with HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. I also work with JavaScript though limited.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Approach to work</h5>
	<p>I start with people. We talk about business needs and look at the situation. Our talks may result in requirements that drive the use cases that I write. I aim to facilitate the business process and make it less error-prone. I am guided by business logic and I refer to design patterns in my approach to projects. I follow standard organizing principles in writing code and care to make it easy to review.</p>
